# Matchbox

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kyleshevlin/matchbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kyleshevlin/matchbox)

A simple JavaScript plugin to match the height of boxes.

## Note

This package should be almost completely unnecessary at this point. I made this before Flexbox and CSS Grid were viable options. The projects I worked on at the time often required that I create a grid of boxes with equal, yet dynamic heights. This was my solution. You should count yourself lucky if you never had to solve this problem (and have it work responsively!).

## Installation

Matchbox is available via NPM. _NOTE:_ `matchboxes` is plural as a `Matchbox` project already exists.

```
$ npm install matchboxes
```

Matchbox is also available on Bower:

```
$ bower install matchboxjs
```

## Usage

```js
var matchbox = new Matchbox({
  initClass: 'js-matchbox-initialized',
  parentSelector: '.js-box',
  childSelector: '.js-match',
  groupsOf: 2,
  breakpoints: []
});

matchbox.init();
```

After adding `matchbox.js` to your project, instantiate a new `Matchbox`, passing in your options object as the first argument, and call the `.init()` function on your Matchbox instance.

## Options

| Option Name | Type | Description | Default Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| initClass | String | class name set on `body` on init | 'js-matchbox-initialized' |
| parentSelector | String | class or id selector | '.js-box' |
| childSelector | String | class or id selector | '.js-match' |
| groupsOf | Integer | Size of groups to process for matches | 2 |
| breakpoints | Array | Array of objects; each object must have a `bp` and a `groupsOf` property. | [] |

## Public Methods

| Method Name | Description |
|---|---|
| init() | initializes the Matchbox instance with |
| groupsOf(number) | Quickly modify the groupsOf setting on a Matchbox instance |
| destroy() | destroys the Matchbox instance and resets all applied heights |
| update() | forces an update of Matchbox instance |

## Behavior of Breakpoints

Matchbox is designed to behave mobile first with no option (currently) to operate otherwise. If you would like a Matchbox instance to automatically update per breakpoint, add objects to the `breakpoints` array at initialization like so:

```javascript
var matchbox = new Matchbox({
  breakpoints: [
    { bp: 480, groupsOf: 3 },
    { bp: 768, groupsOf: 4 }
  ]
});

matchbox.init();
```

Matchbox will sort your breakpoints from smallest to lowest, and then detect when the `window.innerWidth` is greater than or equal to your breakpoint but less than your next breakpoint. It will utilize Matchbox's `groupsOf` method to then update your Matchbox instance.
